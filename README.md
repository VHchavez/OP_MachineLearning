==============================

Generates a correction to DFT calculations

Main scripts are:

Generate Data:
 Atoms.ipynb         Get calculations for individual atoms
 Diatomics.ipynb     Get calculations for diatomics
 
Play with Data:

 KRR_sklearn.ipynb   Grid Search and fitting
 
Data used is located in:

 atoms.csv
 diatoms_raw_full.csv
